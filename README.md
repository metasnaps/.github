MetaMask Snaps: Overview
MetaMask Snaps is an innovative feature within the MetaMask ecosystem. It allows developers to expand the capabilities of the MetaMask wallet through custom plugins. These plugins, known as "Snaps", can be built using JavaScript and are executed in a secure environment. This feature opens up a wide range of possibilities for developers to interact with different blockchain protocols and services directly from the MetaMask wallet.

Usefulness in Cross-Chain Interoperability across the Deltaverse
Cross-Chain Interoperability
Connecting Multiple Blockchains: Snaps can facilitate interactions with various blockchains, not just Ethereum. This is crucial for the Deltaverse, an environment characterized by a multitude of different blockchains.
Customized Transactions and Wallet Interactions: Developers can create Snaps that enable the wallet to perform transactions or interact with smart contracts across different blockchains.
Enhanced User Experience: For users, this means a seamless experience when dealing with assets or dApps across various blockchains, directly from their MetaMask wallet.
Deltaverse - A Multichain Ecosystem
Decentralized and Diverse: The Deltaverse represents a decentralized and diverse ecosystem with numerous blockchains. Snaps play a vital role in bridging these chains, enabling fluid asset transfer and information exchange.
Innovative DApps and Services: Developers can create more innovative dApps and services that operate across different blockchains, leveraging the unique features of each chain.
